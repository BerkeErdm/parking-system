# On-Cloud Parking Management System 
- Project requirements have been determined.
- Documentation was prepared for the project.
- PostgreSQL was used for the database pattern. The database design was made using a database, PgAdmin.
- Used Python Django Framework, then the entity layer was created. And the tables are mapped to the database. Necessary validations were made for all tables in the database. Afterward, special annotations were created for some validations. A query was made to the database. CRUD operations are written to the API layer on the Controller. Tested CRUD operations with Postman and Swagger.
